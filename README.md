A wrapper for the Zenodo API.

## üí™ Getting Started

The first example shows how you can set some configuration then never worry about whether it's been
uploaded already or not - all baked in with [`pystow`](https://github.com/cthoyt/pystow). On the
first time this script is run, the new deposition is made, published, and the identifier is stored
with the given key in your `~/.config/zenodo.ini`. Next time it's run, the deposition will be looked
up, and the data will be uploaded. Versioning is given automatically by date, and if multiple
versions are uploaded on one day, then a dash and the revision are appended.

```python
from zenodo_client import Creator, Metadata, ensure_zenodo

# Define the metadata that will be used on initial upload
data = Metadata(
    title='Test Upload 3',
    upload_type='dataset',
    description='test description',
    creators=[
        Creator(
            name='Hoyt, Charles Tapley',
            affiliation='Harvard Medical School',
            orcid='0000-0003-4423-4370',
        ),
    ],
)
res = ensure_zenodo(
    key='test3',  # this is a unique key you pick that will be used to store
                  # the numeric deposition ID on your local system's cache
    data=data,
    paths=[
        '/Users/cthoyt/Desktop/test1.png',
    ],
    sandbox=True,  # remove this when you're ready to upload to real Zenodo
)
from pprint import pprint

pprint(res.json())
```

A real-world example can be found here: https://github.com/cthoyt/nsockg.

The following example shows how to use the Zenodo uploader if you already know what your deposition
identifier is.

```python
from zenodo_client import update_zenodo

# The ID from your deposition
SANDBOX_DEP_ID = '724868'

# Paths to local files. Good to use in combination with resources that are always
# dumped to the same place by a given script
paths = [
    # os.path.join(DATABASE_DIRECTORY, 'alts_sample.tsv')
    '/Users/cthoyt/Desktop/alts_sample.tsv',
]

# Don't forget to set the ZENODO_API_TOKEN environment variable or
# any valid way to get zenodo/api_token from PyStow.
update_zenodo(SANDBOX_DEP_ID, paths)
```

The following example shows how to look up the latest version of a record.

```python
from zenodo_client import Zenodo

zenodo = Zenodo()
OOH_NA_NA_RECORD = '4020486'
new_record = zenodo.get_latest_record(OOH_NA_NA_RECORD)
```

Even further, the latest version of `names.tsv.gz` can be automatically downloaded to the
`~/.data/zenodo/<conceptrecid>/<version>/<path>` via `pystow` with:

```python
from zenodo_client import Zenodo

zenodo = Zenodo()
OOH_NA_NA_RECORD = '4020486'
new_record = zenodo.download_latest(OOH_NA_NA_RECORD, 'names.tsv.gz')
```

A real-world example can be found [here](https://github.com/pyobo/pyobo/blob/master/src/pyobo/resource_utils.py)
where the latest build of the [Ooh Na Na](https://cthoyt.com/2020/04/18/ooh-na-na.html) nomenclature
database is automatically downloaded from Zenodo, even though the PyOBO package only hardcodes the
first deposition ID.

### Command Line Interface

The zenodo_client command line tool is automatically installed. It can be used from the shell with
the `--help` flag to show all subcommands:

```shell
$ zenodo_client --help
```

It can be run with `zenodo_client <deposition ID> <path 1> ... <path N>`

## ‚¨áÔ∏è Installation

The most recent release can be installed from
[PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/zenodo_client/) with:

```bash
$ pip install zenodo_client
```

The most recent code and data can be installed directly from GitHub with:

```bash
$ pip install git+https://github.com/cthoyt/zenodo-client.git
```

To install in development mode, use the following:

```bash
$ git clone git+https://github.com/cthoyt/zenodo-client.git
$ cd zenodo-client
$ pip install -e .
```

## üôè Contributing

Contributions, whether filing an issue, making a pull request, or forking, are appreciated. See
[CONTRIBUTING.rst](https://github.com/cthoyt/zenodo-client/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst) for more
information on getting involved.

## üç™ Cookiecutter Acknowledgement

This package was created with [@audreyr](https://github.com/audreyr)'s
[cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter) package
using [@cthoyt](https://github.com/cthoyt)'s
[cookiecutter-python-package](https://github.com/cthoyt/cookiecutter-python-package) template.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

The final section of the README is for if you want to get involved by making a code contribution.

### ‚ùì Testing

After cloning the repository and installing `tox` with `pip install tox`, the unit tests in
the `tests/` folder can be run reproducibly with:

```shell
$ tox
```

Additionally, these tests are automatically re-run with each commit in
a [GitHub Action](https://github.com/cthoyt/zenodo-client/actions?query=workflow%3ATests).

### üì¶ Making a Release

After installing the package in development mode and installing
`tox` with `pip install tox`, the commands for making a new release are contained within
the `finish` environment in `tox.ini`. Run the following from the shell:

```shell
$ tox -e finish
```

This script does the following:

1. Uses BumpVersion to switch the version number in the `setup.cfg` and
   `src/zenodo_client/version.py` to not have the `-dev` suffix
2. Packages the code in both a tar archive and a wheel
3. Uploads to PyPI using `twine`. Be sure to have a `.pypirc` file configured to avoid the need for
   manual input at this step
4. Push to GitHub. You'll need to make a release going with the commit where the version was bumped.
5. Bump the version to the next patch. If you made big changes and want to bump the version by
   minor, you can use `tox -e bumpversion minor` after.
